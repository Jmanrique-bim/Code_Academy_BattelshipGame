🎮 Unleashing my inaugural Python project! 🚀

Presenting a Battleship game crafted with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) flair. Engage in a strategic duel against the computer with ships of diverse sizes (2, 3, 4, and 5). While ships may currently share blocks and user inputs might trigger errors, this marks a promising stage for collaboration and improvement.

Excited to share this OOP venture and eager for feedback to shape an enhanced version! 🌐⚙️
